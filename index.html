        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I did several project and here is my two favorites</p>
        <a href="Digital_logical_design_lab_project.zip" target="_blank"> a Digital logical design projects!!</a>
          <p>
            This project was quite challenging yet rewarding. It focused on designing and understanding electrical circuits using logic gates, flip-flops,
            and combinational/sequential logic. I worked on creating optimized circuits that perform specific tasks efficiently. Through this project,
            I gained hands-on experience with Boolean algebra, truth tables, and circuit simplification techniques. It was an insightful experience that
            deepened my understanding of how hardware components interact in computational systems.
            </p>
        <a href="Retro_Vintage_Scrapbook_Travel_Agency_Guide_Presentation_pptx.zip" target="_blank">a Database projects!!</a>
           <p>
            This project was incredibly fascinating as it explored the best ways to organize, store, and retrieve data efficiently.
            I learned how to design relational databases, establish ER diagrams, and write optimized SQL queries to manage large datasets.
            The project involved building a functional database system that connected various types of information while ensuring data integrity, security,
            and normalization. This experience helped me understand the importance of structured data and how databases power modern applications.
